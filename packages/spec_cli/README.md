`Spec` is a command-line built on top of the official `dart test`/`flutter test`
to add new features such as:

- an improved interface inspired from [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- a `--watch` flag, for re-executing test whenever the sources changes
- during watch mode, offer a way to re-execute only failing tests
- supporting both Dart and Flutter projects using the same command
- support for running tests of multiple packages at the same time by using [Melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos) (coming soon)

## Installation

To install `spec`, run:

```sh
dart pub global activate spec_cli
```

You should now be able to run:

```dart
spec --help
```

## Usage

To run tests in a Dart/Flutter project, simply run:

```sh
spec
```

You can optionally filter tests by name using `--name`:

```sh
spec --name "My test"
```

Alternatively, you can execute specific tests by specifying their path:

```sh
spec test/my_test.dart
```

## Watch mode

By specifying `--watch`, spec will enter in watch mode and will listen to file
changes.  
In this mode, Spec will re-run the tests whenever a file change in the project
is detected.

While in watch mode, it is possible to perform extraneous operations during tests:

- By pressing "enter", this will manually stop/restart the tests
- By pressing `f`, Spec will filter tests to execute only failing tests, skipping
  tests that were passing in the previous run.
- When typing `t`, it is possible to update the `--name` filter flag without
  having to restart Spec.
